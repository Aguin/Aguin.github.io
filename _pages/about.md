I am Guanyi Yu (余冠一), an R&D at [QCraft](https://qcraft.ai/en) Perception team. My current research focuses on perception in autonomous driving scenarios, such as camera-based 3D object detection, lane detection, etc. Before joining QCraft, I interned at [MEGVII Research](https://en.megvii.com/megvii_research) and worked closely with [Zeming Li](http://www.zemingli.com/). I obtained my M.E. from the School of Transportation at Southeast University in 2021.
