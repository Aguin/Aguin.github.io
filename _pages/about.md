I am Guanyi Yu (余冠一), an intern at MEGVII Research, mentored by [Zeming Li](http://www.zemingli.com/). My current research focuses on perception in autonomous driving scenarios, such as camera-based 3D object detection, lane detection, etc. Before joining MEGVII, I obtained my M.E. from the School of Transportation at Southeast University in 2021.
